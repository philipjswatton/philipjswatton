## Welcome to my GitHub 👋

I'm Phil, a Data Scientist at the Alan Turing Institute. I'm also a PhD student in the Department of Government at the University of Essex, where I have completed my PhD viva and am now applying corrections to my thesis.

In my spare time outside of work and research projects, I enjoy spending time with my fiancé, reading, and self-learning general programming. You can learn more about me and my research on my website which you can find [at this link](https://philswatton.github.io/).
