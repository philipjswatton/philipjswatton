### Hi there 👋

I'm Phil, a PhD student at the University of Essex.

My research is in the broad intersection of data science, measurement, survey analysis, public opinion, and political parties. I mostly use Github to store my academic work, but also maintain a number of personal projects on my page. You can learn more about me and my research on my website which you can find [at this link](https://philswatton.github.io/).

### What I'm learning at the moment 👨‍🎓

I'm often learning some new skill or method for the purposes of my research. I also have a broader interest in general programming and math and have been pursuing various courses and reading materials when I have time to spare. To help manage my time, I've committed to doing one course and one reading at a time in this extra-curricular learning. In practice, I end up doing these very slowly, based on how much spare time I have.

- **Course**: CS50x Introduction to Computer Science
- **Book**: Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software
- Writing statistical/machine learning algorithms
- Creating R packages
