### Hi there 👋

I'm Phil, a PhD student at the University of Essex.

My research is in the broad realms of measurement, quantitative research methods, statistical programming, public opinion, and elections. At present I use R for my own work, but can use Stata and at a push can use Python. You can learn more about me and my research on my website which you can find [here](https://philswatton.github.io/).

On my github page you'll find repositories for my website, side-projects I'm working on, and for online courses I'm taking.

### What I'm learning 👨‍🎓

Beyond my research, I have an interest in general programming and have been pursuing various courses and reading materials when I have time to spare. To force myself to main a reasonable structure (lest I start too many courses in one go), I've committed to doing one course and one reading at a time. In practice, I usually do these very slowly, based on how much spare time I have.

- 👨‍💻 My current CS course: CS50x
- 📚 My current CS reading: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
