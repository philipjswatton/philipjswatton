### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Phil, a PhD student at the University of Essex.

My research is in the broad realm of public opinion, elections, and quantitative research methods for analysing these things. At present I use R for my own work, but can use Stata and hope to eventually incorporate Python into my toolkit.

At the moment, I keep my research repositories private. I plan to release code when the relevant papers are published (eventually).

Beyond this, I've been learning general programming. I've been slowly chipping away at learning front-end web development (mainly for the purpose of maintaining my own website) via freeCodeCamp and recently started eloquentJS to this end. I've also been slowly working on CS50 to get a better understanding of computer sciencce as in the long term I'm interested in doing some software development as a hobby/side gig.

At the time of writing, most of the public repositories here are either small side projects or random collections of code from small learning projects I've been pursuing. I also have some front-end code stored on CodePen: https://codepen.io/phil-swatton
