### Hi there 👋

I'm Phil, a PhD student at the University of Essex.

My research is in the broad realm of public opinion, elections, and quantitative research methods for analysing these things. At present I use R for my own work (and love it!), but can use Stata and hope to eventually incorporate Python into my research toolkit. You can learn more about me and my research on my website, which is hosted [here](https://philswatton.github.io/) on GitHub pages.

The main thing I currently use GitHub for is for storing the code relating to my research. At the moment these repositories are private, but when I manage to get a publication I aim to create public repositories containing the replication code.

### What I'm learning 👨‍🎓

Beyond this, I have an interest in general programming and have been persuing various courses and reading materials to this effect. To force myself to maintain a structure (else I just start too many courses in one go, I'm trying to stick to one course and one reading at a time.

- 📚 My current reading: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
- 👨‍💻 My current course: CS50

### Other Stuff

I also have one or two other mini-projects on my GitHub and presumably will have more of these (and hopefully one day some larger projects!) over time. I also keep some frontend code I've been trying out on my codepen which can be found [here](https://codepen.io/phil-swatton).
