### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Phil, a PhD student at the University of Essex.

My research is in the broad realm of public opinion, with particular focus on application of research methods. I keep my work on GitHub, but at the moment these repositories are private. I will be making them public once sufficient progress is made.

I also use GitHub to store code from some of the other languages I'm currently learning. You can find my personal website hosted on GitHub pages along with various other random bits of code here.

I also have some code stored on CodePen: https://codepen.io/phil-swatton
